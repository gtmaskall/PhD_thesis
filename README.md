# Abstract

This thesis documents research into the use of feature extraction for achieving robust
automatic target recognition (ATR). Classification experiments were performed on inverse
synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) images of military vehicles. The issue of robustness was
considered over differences between vehicles used for training and those used for testing
a classifier. These differences were broken down into two categories: the vehicle used for
testing was represented during training, but its configuration was different; and the vehicle
used for testing was not represented during training. The specific approach adopted for
performing the feature extraction was a flexible radial basis function network. The merit
of a given set of extracted features was measured through the error rate obtained using the
nearest-neighbour classification rule and compared with linear features. Comparison was
also made with results from a support vector machine. A major result of this work has
been to perform classification on an extensive and varied real-world data set to show that
configuration changes to vehicles are not the major challenge previously thought. Instead
it is recommended that future research tackle the challenge of training a classifier on
simulated or ISAR data and testing on data from an operationally-representative sensor.
